Enhance the model: Try a deeper CNN, or use transfer learning with a pre-trained model like VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet.
Evaluate with a confusion matrix: This will show you exactly how many images are misclassified for each class.
Cross-validation: Use k-fold cross-validation to better estimate model performance.
Check for label noise: Manually inspect some images to ensure labels are correct.
